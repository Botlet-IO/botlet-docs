The MVC architectural pattern is a common approach to software development that separates the user interface from the business logic. It is a popular choice for web applications because it allows for separation of concerns and makes it easier to maintain and update the application.

Mapping: mapping among external systems or users,
View: interacting natively, with native panel or generated/developed panel,
Controller: accepting, routing, forwarding, and responding

## why AI

- service is service
- good at semantic processing, not complex logic inside domain
- break things into 2 stages, orthogonally
- inter-domain mapping, next view

## Most of the time, we are not lack services, but views

request -> current response + next view

c端点，基于client或next端点，封装response + view传递下去

最后在末端拿到response为最初的client封装view

- chain完整的会话上下文中，寻找数据线索，
