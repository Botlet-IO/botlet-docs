After we created a callgent in this recruit example, we can use email and restapi to invoke it to show how to fullfill all recuit tasks.

In the above callgent, we connect a two client endpoints with it, one is email type client endpoint, another is restapi type client endpoint. First we try to use email to invoke the callgent to show how to fullfill all recuit tasks.
