# Introduction

Welcome to the new era of AI software development! But what does that really mean? Let's break it down.

## User as a service

In software development, AI's core value is lowering code generation barriers. But, starting projects from scratch is complex due to ambiguous and complex requirements.

**Callgent** changes the game.

:::tip
Callgent significantly lowers the barriers to just integrating existing services, instead of building from scratch, making AI code generation accessible for all **non-developers**.

Actually, all software development is essentially a series of integrations, e.g., integrating DBs, Redis, ES, APIs, and other middlewares and libraries.

By using Callgent for AI software development, we're paving a **realistic and feasible path** forward. It simplifies the process, ensuring AI's benefits are within reach.

> A basic understanding of the services you're integrating is recommended.

## Webhook

So, how do we leverage AI in software development?

In essence, we strive to make every software service akin to a collaborative teammate, while empowering each user to function like a service in a programming context. To break the silos between users and systems.

To adhere to best practices, we may determine to what extent we want to auto-generate code by AI. Here are the levels to consider:

- Machine code/ASM level
- C/Java/Python/.. language level
- Service orchestration level
- Function-calling level
  - AI knows which and how to invoke an API
- Callable Agent level
  - function-calling outside of chatbox
