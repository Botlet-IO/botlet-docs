# Introduction

Welcome to the new era of AI software development! But what does that really mean? Let's break it down.

## The Core of AI Development

The hard core of software development is all about clearly describing **requirements**. Currently we don't think it's realistic to expect AI to generate an entire software project from scratch.

## Best Practices for AI Code Generation

So, how do we leverage AI in software development? The best practice is to decide to what extent we want to auto-generate code by AI. Here are the levels to consider:

- Machine code/ASM level
- C/Java/Python/.. language level
- Service orchestration level
- Function-calling level
  - AI knows which and how to invoke an API
- Callable Agent level

## Introducing Callgent.com - Callable Agent

Similar to function-calling, Callgent.com - Callable Agent takes it a step further. We're not just stuck function-calling in a chatbox anymore; we're now in native scenarios.
