# Introduction

**User-as-a-Service redefined**. TODO more md widgets

Botlet.io enables your users to be integrated into systems as normal functional services.

Based on this integration, system may call users asynchronously, with callback response;

Also users may call system services, just like chatting with friends.

## Benefits

Bridge all traditional gaps between systems and users:

- Users are always reachable from system point of view:
  - among business processes
  - on business or system exceptions
  - consistent programming experiences by including users as a service
- Easy and intelligent interaction with system from users point of view:
  - just like chatting with friends in a contextual group, powered by our progressing requesting technology
  - zero code development by just botlets and users orchestration
  - everyone may be a product manager
- Orchestrated services may be exposed any where, by polymorphic interface plugins:
  - as mail address
  - in IM channels
  - on generative web pages
  - VR/AR, etc.
