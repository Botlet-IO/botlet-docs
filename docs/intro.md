# Introduction

As AIGC advances, code generation[^1] is one of the most exciting areas of research and businesses.

Ideally, softwares could be developed in natural language and graphs, and the `AI Programmer`[^2] will generate the corresponding code.

Yet in reality, even requirements is hard to be expressed clearly. So AI systems are more as an assistant or tool for programmers, like `copilot`[^3][^4], `UI Generator`[^5], `Bug Fixer`[^6][^7].

`Botlet.IO` is yet another AI tool, focusing on integrating existing systems or users into any native environments, based on the `Progressive function-calling`[^8] technique.

The main difference between `Botlet.IO` and other `function-calling` tools is that it does not just stand in chat-box. On the contrary, the `botlet` can enable a service or user to be embedded into any native scenarios, to be invoked:

- as a native service
- as a webpage
- as an email account
- as on IM user, e.g. `Slack`, `WhatsApp`, ...
- ...

Imaging your team members and customers can be easily invoked as a micro-service, or you can talk to `Amazon` ordering service as a new team member in your slack channel.  
And you can even create an SOP[^9] for them, which is a new approach to AI programming.  

All just in one place, `Botlet.IO` is a new way to integrate AI into your business.
