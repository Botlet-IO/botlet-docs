# Introduction

As AIGC advances, [code generation](https://paperswithcode.com/task/code-generation) is one of the most exciting areas of research and businesses.

Ideally, softwares could be developed in natural language and graphs, and the `AI Programmer`[^1] will generate the corresponding code.

Yet in reality, even requirements are hard to be expressed clearly. So AI systems are more as an assistant or tool for programmers, like `copilot`[^2][^3], `UI Generator`[^4], `Bug Fixer`[^5][^6].

`Callgent` is yet another AI tool, focusing on integrating existing systems or users into any native environments, based on the `progressive function-calling` technique.

The main difference between `Callgent` and other [`function-calling`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) tools is that it does not just stand in chat-box. On the contrary, the `callgent` can enable a service or user to be embedded into any native scenarios, to be invoked:

- as a native service
- as a webpage
- as an email account
- as an IM user, e.g. `Slack`, `WhatsApp`, `WeChat` ...
- ...

Imaging your team members and customers can be easily invoked as a micro-service, or you can talk to `Amazon` ordering service as a new team member in your slack channel.  
And you can even create an [`SOP`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_operating_procedure) for them, which is a new approach to AI programming.  

All just in one place, `Callgent` is the new way to integrate AI into your business.
