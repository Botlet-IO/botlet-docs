# Create a New Botlet

import App from "@site/docs/app"
import CreateBotlet from "./components/CreateBotlet"
import Email from "./components/email"
import RestApi from "./components/restApi"

Now you can create your own botlets, to connect to your personal APPs or company infrastructures.

## Create the Botlet

Create with the botlet name, which will be appeared in the connected systems, representing it's main responsibilities:

<pre> 
<App>
    <CreateBotlet />
</App>
</pre>

:::tip
You may also create the botlet from the [Botlet Hub](../advanced-topics/botlet-hub.md). Just following it's instructions to fill in your own authentication tokens to enable it.
:::

## Call the Botlet

Now you may request the botlet for a task, in the following ways.

### Email

You may directly send an email toï¼š<App><Email /></App> 
 
then wait for reply from the [Botlet Receiver](#connect-the-botlet-to-a-receiver).

:::tip
The email address and API url below, contains botlet UUID, which is available after you'v [created the botlet](#create-a-new-botlet).
:::

### REST API

You may also invoke the botlet via REST API:
<App><RestApi/></App>


:::info
- `callback` parameter is essensial if you need to receive asyncronous response from botlet receiver.
:::

### Web Page

You may also generate a web page with a form or button to send a task to the botlet.

### Integrate with other systems

For example, you may connect the botlet to `Slack`, `Jira`, ..., Apps, so that colleagues can interact with the botlet in the channels;  
Or connect it to your personal Apps like `WhatsApp`, `Instagram`, to let the botlet assist you anywhere seamlessly.

This is achieved by adding a `Callable Plugin` to the botlet, then do some neccessary configurations. You may learn more in the [Callable Plugins](../advanced-topics/botlet-plugins/callable-plugins) section.

:::tip 
Each calling task will be responded by the botlet **assignee**, configured as below.
:::

## Connect the Botlet to a Receiver



2. connect the botlet to a push-able system, email by default: API, app, oauth, jwt, RPA, etc.
3. assign the botlet owner account from system, to receive requesting tasks
4. make the botlet callable: API, from system, pages: auth settings
5. request for a task job, and get response

Imaging how exciting things we can do with the **Botlets**.
